# Xenny From The Block
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got -- I'm still I'm still a web tool for quickly creating and demoing xenharmonic scales. This page is currently live at [http://devinsmith.work/tools/xen](http://devinsmith.work/tools/xen/)

## Web Midi
Your xen scale is playable via web MIDI  -- [browser support list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess) -- although at present, the synth implementation is extremely minimal.

## Scala
Finally, your xen scale is rendered in three tables: one in standard text, and the other two as [scala files (.scl and .kbm)](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) so you can easily import your xen scale into software with Scala support.
